##### Project Overview

Advised by Dr. Somdatta Goswami and collaborating with two other undergraduate students, I created a PINN to solve the 1D heat equation using a custom loss function that enforced the structure of the solution and its boundary condition behaviour. Optimizing this modelâ€™s performance involved investigating loss convergence, identifying poor learning of boundary conditions, and implementing adaptive regularization. This resulted in a reduced boundary loss by six orders of magnitude. Next, we shifted our focus to handling the increased computational cost of the 2D case. We explored low-rank decomposition using forward-mode auto differentiation to separate the PINN on a per-axis basis as a strategy to do so. The repository for this project is available [here](https://github.com/philipladuca24/PINNs-Project).
