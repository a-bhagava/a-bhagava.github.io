          subtitle: | 
            Hi, I’m Anvi! I’m a second-year EECS PhD student at MIT, where I’m advised by Priya Donti.
            My research focuses on alleviating the limitations/bottlenecks of traditional scientific computing methods (e.g., differential equation simulations, iterative solvers) using physics-informed machine learning. My work specifically seeks to address challenges in renewable energy, climate, and power systems applications.
          research: |
            My current projects include (1) 
            developing physics-informed machine learning models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), with applications to accelerating computational fluid dynamics simulations of wind farms (2) designing ML-based power flow solvers using graph learning techniques. Beyond these projects, I am also interested in exploring problems related to weather forecasting and carbon capture.
            Key themes that I explore through my research include: 
            1. Incorporating physics and domain structure into ML models through soft and hard constraints, operator learning, and graph-based methods.
            2. Taking inspiration from numerical solvers (e.g., spectral and wavelet methods) to inform the design of these models.
            3. Developing models that are accessible even in compute-constrained and low-data regimes (e.g., via self-supervised training or multi-fidelity approaches).

          aboutme: |
            I completed my undergraduate degree at Brown University, where I majored in Physics and Applied Mathematics, followed by a Master’s in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell Tech. As an undergrad/master's student, I engaged in a broad range of research experiences involving scientific computing.
            At Brown, I studied superconductivity in 2D graphene systems using experimental methods and Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations in the
            <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/li-lab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #3399ff;">Low-Dimensional Electronics Lab</a>
            (advisors: Jia Li, Brenda Rubenstein). In addition, I developed physics-informed neural networks as part of the
            <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/crunch-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #3399ff;">The Crunch Group</a>
            (advisor: Somdatta Goswami).
            I also had the opportunity to intern at 
            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-for-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #3399ff;">Microsoft Research</a>
            (advisor: Ranveer Chandra) where I worked on creating datasets for food protein property prediction, and 
            startups such as <a href="https://www.aqemia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #3399ff;">Aqemia</a> (drug discovery) and
            <a href="https://transcelestial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #3399ff;">Transcelestial</a> (wireless laser communications).

            Outside of work, I love singing, playing piano, composing music, and reading poetry. 
            I’ve recently started exploring cooking and creating new recipes. 
            I also enjoy film photography, and you can find some of my photos 
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anvi_film/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #3399ff;">here</a>!
