          subtitle: | 
            Hi, I’m Anvi! I’m a second-year EECS PhD student at MIT, where I’m advised by Priya Donti.
            My research focuses on alleviating the limitations of traditional scientific computing methods (e.g., differential equation simulations, iterative solvers) using physics-informed machine learning. My work specifically seeks to address challenges in renewable energy, climate, and power systems applications.
            Key themes that I explore through my research include: 
            1. Embedding governing equations, conservation laws, and domain-specific structures into ML models through soft constraints (loss functions), hard constraints (differentiable optimization), and tools such as operator and graph learning.
            2. Leveraging insights from traditional numerical solvers (e.g., iterative and spectral methods) to inform the design of hybrid physics-informed ML models.
            3. Developing models that are accessible even in compute-constrained and low-data regimes (e.g., via self-supervised training).

            My current projects include (1) improving the prediction of wind-turbine deficits by designing self-supervised operator learning methods to solve the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations and (2) improving ML-based power flow solvers using graph learning techniques.

            I completed my undergraduate degree at Brown University, where I majored in Physics and Applied Mathematics, followed by a Master’s in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell Tech. During my time here, I engaged in a broad range of research experiences involving scientific computing.
            At Brown, I studied superconductivity in 2D graphene systems in the
            <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/li-lab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #3399ff;">Low-Dimensional Electronics Lab</a>
            (advisors: Jia Li, Brenda Rubenstein) and developed physics-informed neural networks in

            (advisor: Somdatta Goswami).
            I have also interned at 
            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-for-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #3399ff;">Microsoft Research</a>
            (advisor: Ranveer Chandra), and startups such as <a href="https://www.aqemia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #3399ff;">Aqemia</a> (drug discovery) and
            <a href="https://transcelestial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #3399ff;">Transcelestial</a> (wireless laser communications).

            Outside of work, I love singing, playing piano, composing music, and reading poetry. 
            I’ve recently started exploring cooking and creating new recipes. 
            I also enjoy film photography, and you can find some of my photos
